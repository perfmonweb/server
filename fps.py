"""Retrieves average FPS and latencies for the target package-name.

Provides refresh rate, total frames, average FPS, and statistics for frame
latencies such as mean, standard deviation, min and max.

To run this script with the CLI:
Syntax:
python3 fps.py [-h] [-d DURATION] [--dump FILENAME] [-l | --print_latency |
--no-print_latency] [-f] package_name

Arguments:
    package_id: (Required) Package name of the application.
    duration or d: (optional) Duration of time we run this script. By default
                the duration is 1 day.
    dump or o: (Optional) File name where stats are stored.
    print_latency or l: (Optional|Experimental) Displays latencies of the last
        120 frames. provide this argument if you want to display the latencies.
    full or f: (Optional) A boolean indicating if we like to skip the partial
        name or not. We have to input full package when this argument is passed.

Example:
    - python3 fps.py -d 30 -o example.txt com.example.app -l
    - python3 fps.py --duration 30 --dump example.txt com.example.app
        --print_latency
